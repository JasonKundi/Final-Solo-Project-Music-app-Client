# Hylla app

Hylla is an early concept music streaming app I have created as my solo final project for my 6 month software developer bootcamp at Boolean. Hylla is an app that acts as a third party integrated app to Spotify which stores and displays a Spotify users playlists but allows them to listen to their music in their own personalised bedroom. The look and feel for Hylla came from my love of classic point and click games but furthermore, his app is inspired by the nostalgia of youth. A time when I would hang out in friends bedrooms and would physically grab music off of their shelf. Those times I felt led to deep discovery of new music and have influenced and shaped the many genres I have listened to now for many years. Music is personal and a song is only complete when shared. That said popular apps like Spotify, however great, don't tempt users enough to go and look at their friends playlists. The option is of course there, but Hylla aims to build on top of Spotify and bring back that interpersonal connection to music sharing for users.

The apps potential in terms of the scope I want to achieve are still in a "beta phase" if you will. However moving forward I wish to implement far more customisable components and the ability for users to find their friends and hang out in their own unique rooms and listen to music
